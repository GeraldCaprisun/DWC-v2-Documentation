## DONDA WITH CLIENT

WARNING:

Regrettably, there were discrepancies in the transaction. The acquisition in question pertained to a 50GB allocation throughout. During a prior amicable association, I had initially suggested selling the 50GB, with the intention of benefiting the involved party. However, I concede to a misjudgment in the price assessment, which led to a standoff as he persisted in accusations regarding purported delays in the procurement process.

Reflecting upon the situation, it becomes evident that adopting a firmer stance from the outset would have been prudent. Subsequently, amidst the stagnation of the GB, I suggested in a group chat involving third parties to provide additional details regarding the acquisition, albeit in a non-specific manner, pertaining to the timeframe encompassing the years 2018-2019. This action was prompted by the immediate concern raised by the party in question, expressing apprehension about potential information leaks from certain entities.

Upon later revelation that the acquisition was not solely limited to 50GB, conveyed through a general communication exchange several days subsequent, I echoed this sentiment in a promotional message related to the GB, albeit with an element of feigned ignorance. This strategy proved to be ill-advised in retrospect.

Efforts to rectify the situation were made recently through renegotiation attempts. However, the counterparty remained steadfast in their refusal to augment the GB with additional resources to render the arrangement mutually beneficial.
